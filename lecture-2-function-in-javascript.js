// for writing a function we have to write function then function name then () then {}

// function declaration

function startFan() {
    console.log('walk towards the switch');
    console.log('press the switch');

}

// function call
//* for activating functin we have to call function by its name ex:

startFan();

// function can be use many times 
console.log('calling the function again');
startFan();

// both function and loop can do a task again and again
//* difference between function and loop

//* in loop we can't do any task while the loop is running

//* in function we can do task and can call it when we need it;
